# Docker-Moodle (ON DEV: DO NOT USE IT)

Well, I'm working on a Docker repo for every Moodle user around the woRllLD. 
As a veteran using Moodle, I'll be adding some nice pre-configs, some nice themes for your Moodle sites, and more (I hope)

For now, we'll be using Trema (https://moodle.org/plugins/pluginversions.php?plugin=theme_trema) because it's a pretty nice theme (in my opinion, you can change it, I don't care). Here's the link for the git repo of Trema: https://github.com/trema-tech/moodle-theme_trema

Greetings :)
